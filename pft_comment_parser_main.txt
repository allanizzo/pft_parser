PRO FOOTBALL TALK COMMENT PARSER

LETS GO ON AND TALK THROUGH WHAT YOU WANT HERE

the objective is to return the comments, sorted by thumbs up and thumbs down.
	you could sort by:
	(1) total votes made
	(2) total up votes
	(3) total down votes
	(4) net positive (up votes - down votes)
	(5) net negative (down votes - up votes)
	(6) up ratio (up votes / down votes)
	(7) down ratio (down votes / up votes)


Ultimately, we want to return the:
	(1) comment metric of choice
	(2) commenter's username
	(3) story headline
	(4) body of comment

	NOTE THAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO SORT BY THE METRIC
