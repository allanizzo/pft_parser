PRO FOOTBALL TALK COMMENT PARSER

LETS GO ON AND TALK THROUGH WHAT YOU WANT HERE

the objective is to return the comments, sorted by thumbs up and thumbs down.
	you could sort by:
	(1) total votes made
	(2) total up votes
	(3) total down votes
	(4) net positive (up votes - down votes)
	(5) net negative (down votes - up votes)
	(6) up ratio (up votes / down votes)
	(7) down ratio (down votes / up votes)


Ultimately, we want to return the:
	(1) comment metric of choice
	(2) commenter's username
	(3) story headline
	(4) body of comment

	NOTE THAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO SORT BY THE METRIC

	I THINK KEEPING A HASH IS THE RIGHT WAY TO STORE DATA

Crawling
	We will need to crawl pages
	Do we crawl the entire PFT site?
	How do we damp the crawling?
	Prevent outside links from being hit?

WRITE OUT HOW THE THING WORKS
	- start with seed page, maybe a story or a kind of main page
	- amass a list of links that are the kind of links you want to go to
		^ stories and posts about football, with comments
	- go to the link and return the contents of the page (as HTML?)
	- pick out the contents of the page that you want (per comment)
		- metric
		- comment
		- username
		- story headline
	- store this information (presumably in a hash)
	- put the link of the page in the links crawled list
	- return the hash sorted and possibly truncated however you want


MODULAR - what are the modular components of this app?
	- link amassing
	- crawling
	- content extraction / storing
